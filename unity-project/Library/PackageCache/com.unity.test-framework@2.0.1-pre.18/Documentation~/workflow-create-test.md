# Workflow: Creating tests

To create a test through the **Test Runner** window:

1. [Create your Test Assembly folder](./workflow-create-test-assembly.md) and select it in the **Project** window.
2. Open the Test Runner window (menu: **Window** > **General** > **Test Runner**).
3. Click the **Create a new Test Script in the active path** button in the **Test Runner** window.

Alternatively, use the **Asset** menu:

1. In the **Project** window, select the new folder.
2. Create a new test script in the folder (menu: **Assets > Create > Testing > C# Test Script**).

This creates a `NewTestScript.cs` file in the *Tests* folder with some sample tests to get you started. Change the name of the script, if necessary, and press Enter to accept it.

Now youâ€™ll see the sample tests in the Test Runner window:

Now you can open the tests in your favorite script editor.

> **Note**: Unity does not include test assemblies (NUnit, Unity Test Framework, and user script assemblies) when using the normal build pipeline, but does include them when using **Run Location: On Player<Platform>** in the **Test Runner** window.

## Creating Play Mode tests

The process for creating a Play Mode test is the same as for creating an Edit Mode test. The only relevant differences are:

* Play Mode tests that need to [run in a standalone platform Player](./workflow-run-playmode-test-standalone.md) should be in an assembly that references the required platform. 
* Play Mode tests that are part of an Editor assembly should be annotated in the test script with a [RequiresPlayModeAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.TestTools.RequiresPlayModeAttribute.html) so that they run in the Editor's Play Mode.
