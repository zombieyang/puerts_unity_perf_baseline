6. New concept `LazyBinding`：
    In 1.3- when you write `return false` in filter for some c# member. That member will still do TypeRegist by reflection could be call during runtime.
    Now, this feature will still work. But that kind of member will do reflection during first invoke but not during TypeRegister.
 8. New form of `filter`
     To compat with the new `LazyBinding` mode. `Filter` now can not only return a boolean but can return a `BindingMode`. Which is a enum inculde `FastBinding` (means will generate static wrapper)、`LazyBinding` (mentioned above)、`DontBinding` (can not be called during runtime)。you can find an example in `U2018Compatible.cs`
